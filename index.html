    	   <p>TurboTax Online: Important Details about Filing Form <span>1040</span> Returns with Limited Credits

          A Form 1040 return with limited credits is one that's filed using IRS Form 1040 only (with the exception of the specific covered situations described below). Roughly 37% of taxpayers are eligible.</p>

          <p id="PAGE">If you have a Form 1040 return and are claiming limited credits only, you can file for free yourself with TurboTax Free Edition or TurboTax Live Assisted Basic (if available), or you can file with TurboTax Full Service at the listed price.</p>
